I am a PhD student at the [Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.ia.cas.cn/). My primary research focuses on **Brain-inspired Intelligence**, **Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)**, and **Neuromorphic data processing**. I have also been exploring research in the fields of **Artificial Intelligence Model** and **Large Language Model (LLMs)** security. During my doctoral studies, my main interest has been in **unsupervised learning in Brain-inspired systems**.

I have published papers in journals such as **PNAS**, **Scientific Data**, **iScience**, **Patterns**, **Pattern Recognition**, **Neural Networks** and **IEEE TAI**. My work has also been presented at AI conferences, including **NeurIPS** and **AAAI**.

    <h3><strong>EventZoom</strong>  Accepted by AAAI-2025</h3>
    <p><strong>EventZoom</strong> proposes a data augmentation method for event data that effectively enhances the model's generalization ability in event data training by maintaining temporal continuity and spatial integrity. Under supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised experiments, <strong>EventZoom</strong> consistently achieves better performance. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17167" target="_blank">Read more on arXiv</a>.</p>
